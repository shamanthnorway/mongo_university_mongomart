# Final Project

### Description
This final project is part of **M101JS: MongoDB for Node.js Developers**. 

In this project I was able to put together everything that was covered through the course to build a complete application backed by MongoDB.

### How to start?
	- The data is present in the `/data` folder and this needs to be imported to a MongoDB database. 
	- Then run Node.js by execution the command `node mongomart` (This command needs to be executed in the directory where mongomart.js is present).
